Understanding Age Longevity in America

Introduction

This project focuses on developing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model by leveraging a county-level data set sourced from the County Health Rankings Organization, which includes a wide range of health and demographic indicators, such as diabetes prevalence, income, unemployment rates, % rural, smoking prevalence, and more. This model will be designed to predict whether a county falls into the category of "High" or "Low" life expectancy. In doing so, we aim to better understand the factors that contribute to disparities in life longevity across different counties and find the best hyperparameter for the according model.
